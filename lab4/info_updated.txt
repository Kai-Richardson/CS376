We are the Pilots at the University of Portland.
Since 1901 the University of Portland has devoted 
itself      to an education of the      heart and mind by 
focusing on three central elements: teaching, 
faith, and service. 

Since the day it opened in 
September 1901 with      52 boys and      8 professors, the 
University has grown to a vibrant intellectual 
community of over 3,800 students and 300 professors.
