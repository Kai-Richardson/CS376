  Contract Bridge

When this page was first written (in late 1995), there was already a
fair amount of bridge-related information on the Internet, but most of
it was aimed at people who already knew how to play. This page was
produced to fill the gap by explaining how bridge is played. The
explanation is intended for people who have some experience of cards and
card games, but no knowledge of bridge.

In the following years, several other sites with information of use to
bridge beginners appeared. Some of these appear among the links
<#resources> at the end of this page.

    Types of Bridge

Contract Bridge was invented in the 1920's and in the following decades
it was popularised especially in the USA by Ely Culbertson. Bridge
currently occupies a position of great prestige, and is more
comprehensively organised than any other card game. There are clubs,
tournaments and championships throughout the world.

Rubber Bridge <#rubber> is the basic form of Contract Bridge, played by
four players. Informal social bridge games are often played this way,
and rubber bridge is also played in clubs for money.

Duplicate Bridge <#duplicate> is the game normally played in clubs,
tournaments and matches. The game is basically the same but the luck
element is reduced by having the same deals replayed by different sets
of players. At least eight players are required for this. There are some
significant differences in the scoring. Two types of duplicate bridge
will be covered:

    * teams of four <#teams>
    * pairs <#pairs> 

Chicago <#chicago> is a version of Bridge played by four people over
four deals.

Contract Bridge developed in the 1920's from Auction Bridge, which is
different mainly in the scoring. In Auction Bridge, overtricks count
towards making game, so it is only necessary to bid high enough to win
the contract - there is no incentive to bid all the tricks you can make.

Before Auction Bridge there was Bridge-Whist or Straight Bridge (at the
time this game was just called Bridge). Here is a link to the earliest
published rules of Bridge <biritch.html>, which appeared in 1886 under
the name Biritch or Russian Whist. In Bridge-Whist there is no bidding
at all - the dealer either names a trump suit or passes, in which case
the dealer's partner must choose trumps. In either case the dealer's
partner is dummy. Either opponent may double before the lead to the
first trick, and if doubled, the dealer's side may redouble. In the
earliest form of the game, after any redouble, the other side can
redouble again, and this can continue indefinitely.

The duplicate format, in which the same cards are played at more than
one table, has been in use since the 19th century for competitions in
Auction Bridge, Straight Bridge, their ancestor Whist
<../whist/whist.html>, and several other four-player card games, as well
as for Contract Bridge from its invention to the present day.


    Rubber Bridge


      Players and Cards

There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Partners sit facing
each other. It is traditional to refer to the players according to their
position at the table as North, East, South and West, so North and South
are partners playing against East and West. The game is played clockwise.

A standard 52 card pack is used. The cards in each suit rank from
highest to lowest: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2.


      Deal

The cards are shuffled by the player to dealer's left and cut by the
player to dealer's right. The dealer deals out all the cards one at a
time so that each player has 13. Turn to deal rotates clockwise.

It is traditional to use two packs of cards. During each deal, the
dealer's partner shuffles the other pack and places it to the right. The
dealer for the next hand then simply needs to pick up the cards from the
left and pass them across to the right to be cut. Provided all the
players understand and operate it, this procedure saves time and helps
to remember whose turn it is to deal, as the spare pack of cards is
always to the left of the next dealer.


      Bidding

There is next an auction to decide who will be the declarer. A bid
specifies a number of tricks and a trump suit (or that there will be no
trumps). The side which bids highest will try to win at least that
number of tricks bid, with the specified suit as trumps.

When bidding, the number which is said actually represents the number of
tricks *in excess of six* which the partnership undertakes to win. For
example a bid of "two hearts" represents a contract to win at least 8
tricks (8 = 6 + 2) with hearts as trumps.

For the purpose of bidding the possible trump suits rank as follows: no
trumps (highest), spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs (lowest). A bid of a
larger number of tricks always beats a bid of a smaller number, and if
the number of tricks bid are equal, the higher suit beats the lower. The
lowest bid allowed is "one club" (to win at least 7 tricks with clubs as
trumps), and the highest is "seven no trumps" (to win all 13 tricks
without trumps). /NB. In North America, the term for contracts played
without a trump suit is "notrump" or "no trump" (without an 's')./

It is also possible, during the auction, to "double" a bid by the other
side or to "redouble" the opponents' double. Doubling and redoubling
essentially increase the score for the bid contract if won and the
penalties if lost. If someone then bids higher, any previous doubles and
redoubles are cancelled.

Note that doubling does not affect the ranking of a bid - for example a
bid of two spades is always higher than two hearts, even if the two
hearts bid has been doubled or redoubled.

The dealer begins the auction, and the turn to speak passes clockwise.
At each turn a player may either:

    * make a bid, which must be higher than the previous bid if any;
    * say "double", if the previous bid was by an opponent, and has not
      already been doubled;
    * say "redouble", if the previous bid was by one's own side and has
      been doubled by an opponent, but not yet redoubled;
    * pass, by saying "no bid" or "pass". This indicates that the player
      does not wish to bid, double or redouble on that round, but a
      player who has passed is still allowed to bid, double or redouble
      at a later turn. /NB. Either "no bid" or "pass" is permissible,
      but you should stick to one term or the other. "No bid" is usual
      in Britain; "pass" is usual in the USA./ 

If all four players pass on their first turn to speak the hand is said
to be *passed out*. The cards are thrown in and the next dealer deals.

If anyone bids, then the auction continues until there are three passes
in succession, and then stops. After three consecutive passes, the last
bid becomes the *contract*. The team who made the final bid will now try
to make the contract. The first player of this team who mentioned the
denomination (suit or no trumps) of the contract becomes the *declarer*.
The declarer's partner is known as the *dummy*.

Example of an auction (North dealt):

 North      East      South       West
 pass      1 heart    double     3 hearts
3 spades    pass     4 spades     pass
 pass       pass

North-South will try to win at least 10 tricks with spades as trumps;
North, who mentioned spades first, is the declarer. South's double of
one heart was cancelled by West's bid of 3 hearts.


      The Play

dummy The player to the left of the declarer leads to the first trick
and may play any card. Immediately after this opening lead, the dummy's
cards are exposed. The dummy should arrange them neatly in suits, the
cards of each suit arranged in rank order in an overlapping column,
pointing towards the declarer, so that all the cards are clearly
visible. The trump suit if any should be to dummy's right (declarer's
left); in the diagram, spades are trump.

Play proceeds clockwise. Each of the other three players in turn must if
possible play a card of the same suit that the leader played. A player
with no card of the suit led may play any card. A trick consists of four
cards, one from each player, and is won by the highest trump in it, or
if no trumps were played by the highest card of the suit led. The winner
of a trick leads to the next, and may lead any card.

Each trick is gathered together and turned face down when complete, but
you may ask to see the cards and ask who played which card until you or
your partner has played to the next trick. The tricks won are to be
arranged neatly in front of one member of the winning side, so that they
can easily be counted.

Dummy takes no active part in the play of the hand. Whenever it is
dummy's turn to play, the declarer must say which of dummy's cards is to
be played, and dummy plays the card as instructed (provided that it is
legal). Dummy is not permitted to offer any advice or comment on the
play. When dummy wins a trick, the declarer specifies which card dummy
should lead to the next trick. If when calling for a card the declarer
specifies the suit only, dummy is to play the lowest card of that suit.

It is also legal, and not unusual, for the declarer to play dummy's
cards by physically taking them from dummy's hand rather than just
calling for them. This allows the dummy player to leave the table during
the play of the hand.


      Scoring

As its name suggests, rubber bridge is played in *rubbers*. A rubber is
the best of three *games*. A game is won by the first team to score 100
or more *points* for successful contracts, over several deals if necessary.

A side which has already won one game towards the current rubber is said
to be *vulnerable*. A side which has not yet won a game is *not
vulnerable*. A side which is vulnerable is subject to higher bonuses and
penalties than one that is not.

The score is kept on a piece of paper divided into two columns headed WE
and THEY, for the two teams, with a horizontal line part-way down (see
example <#example-rbs>). Scores for successful contracts are entered
*below the line*, and count towards winning a game. Other scores, such
as bonuses for tricks made in excess of the contract (/overtricks/), or
penalties for tricks short of the contract (/undertricks/) are entered
above the line, and do not count towards winning the game.


        Score for making the contract

For a successful contract, the score below the line for each trick (in
excess of 6) bid and made is as follows:

    * If trumps are *Clubs* or *Diamonds*, *20* per trick
    * If trumps are *Hearts* or *Spades*, *30* per trick
    * If there are *No Trumps*, *40* for the first trick, and *30* for
      each subsequent trick. 

If the contract was doubled the above scores are doubled. If it was
doubled and redoubled, they are multiplied by 4.

In addition, the declarer's side scores an extra 50 points above the
line if they succeed in a doubled contract. This is sometimes known as
"50 for the insult". For making a redoubled contract the bonus is 100
above the line.

Because of the difference in score, clubs and diamonds are called the
*minor suits* and hearts and spades are the *major suits*.


        Slam bonus

A contract to make 12 tricks is known as a *small slam*. A contract to
make all 13 tricks is called a *grand slam*. For bidding and making a
slam, declarer's side get an extra bonus above the line, depending on
their vulnerability, as follows:

Slam bonus         small slam       grand slam
not vulnerable        500              1000
vulnerable            750              1500


        Score for overtricks

If the declarer's side wins more tricks than were bid, and were not
doubled, then in addition to the score below the line for the contract,
they score for the overtricks above the line at the same rate as for bid
tricks - i.e. 20 per trick if a minor suit was trumps; 30 per trick in a
major suit or no trumps.

If the contract was doubled or redoubled, the bonus for overtricks does
not depend on the trump suit, but does depend on whether the declarer's
side was vulnerable as follows:

Score per overtrick    doubled    redoubled
not vulnerable           100         200
vulnerable               200         400


        Penalty for undertricks

If the declarer's side win fewer tricks than they bid, neither side
scores anything below the line, but the declarer's opponents score above
the line. This score depends on the declarer's side's vulnerability, and
whether the contract was doubled or redoubled, as follows:

Undertrick penalty:            not vulnerable    vulnerable

Not doubled - each undertrick:       50             100

Doubled - first undertrick:         100             200
Doubled - 2nd and 3rd undertrick:   200 each        300 each
Doubled - subsequent undertricks:   300 each        300 each

Redoubled undertricks cost twice as much as doubled undertricks.


        Honours

The top five trumps (A K Q J 10) are called honours. If one player holds
all five of these cards, that player's side scores a bonus of 150 above
the line. Four honours in one hand score 100. If there are no trumps,
and a player holds four aces, that player's side scores 150 for honours.

Scores for honours are to be claimed at the end of the play (it is
assumed that the players will remember what they held).

As there is no skill in scoring for honours, players often agree to play
without the honour bonuses.


        Game and Rubber

A side that accumulates 100 points or more below the line has won a
game. A new line is drawn under the scores. Anything the opponents had
below the line does not count towards the next game - they start from
zero again.

It is important to notice that, starting from zero and in the absence of
doubles, to make a game in one hand you need to succeed in a contract of
at least three no trumps, four spades, four hearts, five clubs or five
diamonds.

The side which first wins two games wins the rubber. For this they get a
bonus of 700 if they won it two games to zero, or 500 if it was two
games to one. Both sides' scores are then totalled and if the game is
being played for money, the side with the higher score wins an amount
proportional to the difference in scores from the side with the lower
score.

If play ends for any reason with a rubber unfinished, then a side with a
game gets a bonus of 300 points, and a side with a *part score* (i.e. a
score below the line towards an uncompleted game) gets a bonus of 100.


        Example of Rubber Bridge scoring

The scoresheet of a completed rubber might look like the example below.
(The letters in brackets indicate successive deals as described in the
corresponding footnotes - they would not appear on the scoresheet.)

      WE       |    THEY
               |
     500 (f)   |
      50 (f)   |
     100 (f)   |  
     200 (e)   |    500 (i)
     300 (b)   |     30 (g)
      60 (a)   |     30 (c)
  =============|==============    <-- the line
      60 (a)   |    100 (c)
  -------------|--------------    (c)
     360 (f)   |     90 (d)
  -------------|--------------    (f)
      60 (h)   |     40 (g)
               |     90 (i)

(a) we bid 2 hearts and made 10 tricks - 60 below the line for the
contract and 60 above for the overtricks
(b) they bid 4 spades, we doubled them, and they took only 8 tricks - we
score 100 for their first undertrick and 200 for the second
(c) they bid 3 no trumps and made 10 tricks. This gives them a game (100
below the line) plus 30 above the line for their overtrick. A new line
is ruled below the scores to indicate the start of a new game.
(d) they bid and made 3 spades
(e) they bid two diamonds and made 6 tricks - they are now vulnerable so
we score 100 for each undertrick.
(f) we bid 6 hearts; they doubled us, but we won all 13 tricks. We score
360 (180 x 2) below the line for our doubled contract, giving us a game;
100 above for our doubled non-vulnerable overtrick; 50 above for making
a doubled contract; and 500 bonus for a small slam bid and made.
(g) they bid one no trump and took 8 tricks; note that their 90 on deal
(d) was part of the previous game, so the 40 below does not give them a
game.
(h) we bid 3 clubs and made exactly 9 tricks.
(i) they bid 3 hearts and took exactly 9 tricks giving their second game
and the rubber, for a bonus of 500 (two games to one).

Adding up the scores, we have 1690 and they have 880. Therefore we have
won by 810 points (even though they won the rubber).

In this example the "above the line" scores were entered starting
immediately above the line and working upwards. This is traditional, at
least in Britain, but not necessary - you can start at the top, just
below the WE-THEY headings, and work downwards if you prefer.

John Paton has produced a slide show version of the above example - it
is available as an Open Office presentation <Bridge_scoring.odp> and as
a Powerpoint presentation <Bridge_scoring.ppt>.


        * Note on changes in scoring

Some details of bridge scoring were changed in 1987 for duplicate bridge
and in 1993 for rubber bridge. Before the changes, the penalty for
doubled undertricks when not vulnerable was 100 for the first and 200
each for *all* others (and twice as much for a redoubled contract). Also
the bonus for making a redoubled contract was 50, not 100, and the bonus
for a part score in an uncompleted rubber was 50, not 100.


      Partnership agreement and conventions

As in most card games, partners are forbidden to convey information to
each other by talking, gestures, facial expression, etc. However there
is considerable scope for partners to exchange information within the
rules of the game by their choice of bids or cards played.

The bidding mechanism is such that if a player makes a bid (or double or
redouble), it is always possible for the player's partner at their next
turn to override that bid with a higher bid. This makes it possible for
partners to assign arbitrary meanings to bids. Bids which can be taken
at face value - that is they convey a genuine wish to play a contract to
take the relevant number of tricks or more with the trump suit stated -
are called *natural*. Bids which carry an agreed meaning other than this
are called *artificial* or *conventional*.

For example if we are partners, we might agree that a bid of one club by
me shows a strong hand, but has nothing to do with wanting clubs as
trumps. Provided that we both understand this, you will not leave me to
play a contract of one club, but will make some other bid, natural or
artificial. Another example: since doubling a low-level suit contract in
the hope of a penalty is unlikely to be profitable, almost all players
use an agreement that in certain situations a double simply shows a good
hand (perhaps with additional specifications) and asks partner to bid -
this is known as a *takeout double*.

The main restriction on agreements between partners about the meaning of
bids is that all such agreements must be declared to the opponents. A
*bidding system* is a comprehensive set of partnership agreements about
the meanings of bids, whether artificial or natural. For natural bids,
players commonly have agreements on the number of cards held in a bid
suit: for example in some natural systems, opening the bidding with one
of a major suit implies a holding of at least five cards, while others
require only four or more cards in the suit. Agreements also often
relate to high cards held in the bid suit or in the hand generally. The
overall strength of a hand is often measured in *"high-card points"*,
counting each ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, and 0 for other cards - an
approach originally developed by and named after Milton Work in the 1920's.

Players should declare their system (if any) at the start of a session.
Many clubs and tournaments require that this be done by means of a
*convention card* which sets out the meanings of bids. In addition, an
player may, at their turn to bid or play, ask for and be given an
explanation of the opponents' bidding agreements. The explanation should
be given by the partner of the player who made the bid in question. For
example, if I double a suit contract, either opponent may, at their
turn, ask my partner what the double means, and my partner must answer
according to any agreement we may have about the meaning of the double -
for example that it is for takeout or for penalties. If we have no
agreement on this, partner should say so - players are not required or
permitted to speculate or to guess at the meanings of bids in answer to
such a question.

It is sometimes agreed that after the auction, the declarer's left hand
opponent, having asked any necessary questions about the declarer's
side's bidding agreements, leads the first card face down. The other
opponent may then ask questions about the declarer's side's bidding,
after which dummy's cards are exposed and play continues as usual. This
procedure minimises the risk that by asking a question you may give
unauthorised information <#ui> to your partner. Asking at other times
during the bidding or play, though legal and sometimes necessary, might
be taken to imply that your next bid or play will depend on the answer
given.

Similar considerations apply to the play. Partners may agree on the
meaning of the choice of card played in certain circumstances. For
example we may agree that when leading from a sequence of adjacent high
cards such as K-Q-J we always lead the highest. Again, the opponents are
entitled to know about such agreements. They should be declared on the
convention card, and may be asked about during the play.

In rubber bridge one does not often come across complicated systems and
partnership agreements. One is often playing with an unfamiliar partner,
or in an informal setting. Complicated agreements are more often
encountered in duplicate bridge, where the players are often long
standing partners who have devoted considerable effort to agreeing their
system.


    Duplicate Bridge

In rubber bridge <#rubber>, although the better players have a noticable
edge and will undoubtedly win in the long run, the outcome of a single
rubber depends heavily on which side is dealt the better cards. The idea
of *duplicate bridge* is to eliminate this element of luck, by having
the same hands played more than once, by different sets of players.

Suppose we are partners and play a hand of duplicate bridge as
North-South. Instead of being rewarded for our absolute score on that
hand, our score is compared with those of other players who played the
same deal as North-South against other opponents. We win if we score
better than other players managed with our cards, and lose if we score
worse.

For this comparison to be fair, it is necessary that each group of
players who play the same deal should start from the same position.
Therefore it is not practicable to play rubbers, where the scores
carried forward from deal to deal affect the tactical situation.
Instead, each deal is scored in its own right, and does not affect the
scores for subsequent ones. The concept of vulnerability is retained,
but on each deal the vulnerability is preassigned.


      Boards

An almost essential piece of apparatus for playing duplicate bridge is a
set of *duplicate boards*, and a pack of cards for each board. Each
board contains four pockets marked North, East, South and West in which
the cards for the four players are stored. Each board also carries a
number to identify it, and has marks showing which of the players is
dealer and whether each team is vulnerable or not. The marking of the
boards is as follows:

    * Board 1: dealer North; neither side vulnerable
    * Board 2: dealer East; North-South vulnerable
    * Board 3: dealer South; East-West vulnerable
    * Board 4: dealer West; both sides vulnerable
    * Board 5: dealer North; North-South vulnerable
    * Board 6: dealer East; East-West vulnerable
    * Board 7: dealer South; both sides vulnerable
    * Board 8: dealer West; neither side vulnerable
    * Board 9: dealer North; East-West vulnerable
    * Board 10: dealer East; both sides vulnerable
    * Board 11: dealer South; neither side vulnerable
    * Board 12: dealer West; North-South vulnerable
    * Board 13: dealer North; both sides vulnerable
    * Board 14: dealer East; neither side vulnerable
    * Board 15: dealer South; North-South vulnerable
    * Board 16: dealer West; East-West vulnerable 

After board 16 the pattern repeats - board 17 is like board 1, board 18
like board 2 and so on.

Before the boards are played the cards are shuffled, dealt and placed in
the pockets, by a neutral person or by a player in the presence at least
one opponent. Alternatively the cards may be dealt by computer, with the
aim of ensuring perfect randomness. Generally, the computer produces
printed slips (a *hand record* or a set of *curtain cards*) which
specify which cards should be in each hand on each board; a neutral
person then has to construct the hands and put them in the pockets. It
is also possible for the playing cards to be physically sorted and
placed in the boards by a machine controlled by the computer. Cheaper
systmes do this by means of a bar code printed on each card; more
expensive systems use optical character recognition (OCR) to identify
standard playing-cards.

When about to play a board, the players take their cards from the
appropriate pockets, check to see that they have 13 each, and then bid
as usual. The mark on the board showing the 'dealer' in practice just
indicates which player is to begin the bidding. The opening lead is
always made face down, as explained above <#lead_face_down>, to give the
leader's partner an opportunity to ask questions about the bidding
before the led card is shown. During the play, the cards are not played
in the centre of the table but in front of the players. At the end of
each trick, all four players turn their played card face down. The cards
played by each player are overlapped, with the longer axis of the card
pointing to the winners of the trick (i.e. the cards belonging to tricks
you have won are placed upright from your point of view, and the ones
belonging to lost tricks sideways). That way you can easily see how many
tricks you have won. Also, if the cards are kept in order, any dispute
about revokes <../mech.html#revoke> or tricks won or lost can be settled
by reconstructing the play. At the end of the play, each player's cards
are gathered up and replaced in the correct pocket, ready for the next
time the board is to be played.

When this method of play is used, dummy is expected to remain at the
table if at all possible, and declarer then always calls dummy's cards
rather than pulling them from the dummy. You may ask to look at the
cards played to a trick by the other players as long as your own card is
face up. Once you have turned your card face down, you no longer have
the right to see any of the other cards played to that trick. (Unless
you are dummy, you are still allowed to peek at your /own/ played card,
/without exposing it/, until the lead is made to the next trick.)


      Scoring

Each board is marked to show whether both sides, one side or neither
side is vulnerable for that board. You still need to score at least 100
points for tricks bid and made to make a *game*, but on each board, both
sides start with zero points towards games - there are no 'part scores'
carried forward.

In place of the rubber bonus, there are game and part score bonuses:

Making a game when vulnerable:       500 points
Making a game when not vulnerable:   300 points
Making a part score any time:         50 points

The rest of the scores are the same as in rubber bridge, except that
there are no bonuses for honours in duplicate bridge. So for example:

    * if we bid 2 spades and make 4 (10 tricks) we score 170, that is 60
      for two spades bid and made, 60 for two overtricks and 50 for the
      part score;
    * if we bid 4 spades and make it when we are not vulnerable we score
      420 (120 for the contract and 300 for the game);
    * if we bid 4 spades and make it when we are vulnerable we score 620
      (120 for the contract plus 500 for the game). 

These scores are of course not yet the final scores. They have yet to be
compared with the scores achieved by other people who have played the
same cards as us on this board. The method of doing this comparison
varies according to what kind of duplicate is being played. Perhaps the
commonest types are teams of four <#teams> with international matchpoint
(*IMP*) scoring, and matchpointed pairs <#pairs>.


      Teams of Four

A match can be played between two teams of four - eight players in all.
Each team consists of two partnerships, and you need two tables -
preferably in separate rooms so that players cannot overhear events at
the other table. Before starting the players agree how many boards will
be played - this could be 24, 32, 48 or more, depending on the
seriousness of the match and the time available. A 24 board match should
easily be completed within three hours. Shorter matches, sometimes of as
few as 6 boards, are commonly played if the match is part of a larger
tournament.

Call the tables *1* and *2* and the teams *A* and *B*. Then the pairs of
team A sit North-South at table 1 and East-West at table 2, and the
pairs of team B occupy the other seats. Take a convenient number of
boards - say boards 1 to 12 - and give the first 6 to table 1 and the
other 6 to table 2. As each table finishes their 6 boards they are
passed to the other table to be replayed. Since none of the players
should go near the other table before everyone has played all 12 boards,
it is best if the boards are transferred from table to table by a
neutral referee; if none is available, the boards that have been played
once can be left in a place away from both tables for collection by the
players from the other table. When all 12 boards have been played at
both tables, it is a convenient time to have a break and compare scores.

It may be agreed that for the next session, the two pairs of one of the
teams should swap places. This gives each pair the opportunity to play
against both pairs of the opposing team. The procedure about the number
of sessions in a match and the choice of seats for each session may be
laid down by the organiser of the event - otherwise it needs to be
agreed between the team captains.

Each player should have a score card to record the score on each board.
The card has a row for each board. The beginning of North's card from
table 1, when completed, might look like this:

   Board       Final                      Score           IMPs
Deal # Vul    Contract   By   Tricks   Plus   Minus    Plus   Minus

 N   1  -       4S       S      10      420
 E   2  NS      5D*      W       8      500
 S   3  EW      3NT      W      12             690
 W   4  All     2H       N       9      140                        

In the contract column 5D* means 5 diamonds doubled. The 'By' column
shows who was declarer. The score is recorded from North's point of view
- so when West goes down in 5 diamonds it is positive. The IMPs can only
be filled in when this card is compared with one of the cards from the
other room. Some players prefer to enter the number of over- or
undertricks in the "Tricks" column rather than the total number of
tricks taken. In that case the "Tricks" column entries for the four
boards in the above example would read "=, -3, +3, +1". Suppose that our
team mate East on table 2 has a card like this:

   *Board       Final                      Score           IMPs
Deal # Vul    Contract   By   Tricks   Plus   Minus    Plus   Minus*

 N   1  -       4S       S      11             450
 E   2  NS      4H       N      10             620
 S   3  EW      6NT      W      12     1440       
 W   4  All     4H       N       9      100                        

Now the differences can be converted to IMPs for the team. The following
standard table is used:

*Point difference    IMPs*

    0 -   10         0
   20 -   40         1
   50 -   80         2
   90 -  120         3
  130 -  160         4
  170 -  210         5
  220 -  260         6
  270 -  310         7
  320 -  360         8
  370 -  420         9
  430 -  490        10
  500 -  590        11
  600 -  740        12
  750 -  890        13
  900 - 1090        14
 1100 - 1290        15
 1300 - 1490        16
 1500 - 1740        17
 1750 - 1990        18
 2000 - 2240        19
 2250 - 2490        20
 2500 - 2990        21
 3000 - 3490        22
 3500 - 3990        23
 4000 or more       24

So in the example, on the first board the difference between the two
tables was 30 against us, and we lose 1 IMP. On the second board we lose
3 IMPs. Although on table 1 our North-South pair defeated West's 5
diamonds, on table 2 with the same cards our East-West pair allowed
North to play and make 4 hearts. On board 3, where we bid the small slam
on table 2, while they stopped in game on table 1, we gain 13 IMPs for a
750 point difference. On board 4 both Norths made 9 tricks in hearts,
but we gain 6 IMPs because our North-South pair just bid 2 hearts rather
than 4. Overall we are 15 IMPs ahead on those four boards.

After each scoring interval, the captains of the teams should check that
the scores agree. The purpose of every player keeping score is to make
it easier for errors to be traced and corrected.

At the end of the match, the result is the difference in IMPs between
the teams. Sometimes there is then a further conversion of this margin
into a match result, in which some fixed number of *victory points* is
apportioned between the teams. There is no single standard conversion
table, but here is an example table for a 24 board match:

*IMP difference    Victory Points*

    0 -  2            10 - 10
    3 -  6            11 -  9
    7 - 11            12 -  8
   12 - 16            13 -  7
   17 - 21            14 -  6
   22 - 27            15 -  5
   28 - 33            16 -  4
   34 - 39            17 -  3
   40 - 46            18 -  2
   47 - 54            19 -  1
   55 or more         20 -  0

In the example, if we were still 15 IMPs ahead having played 24 boards,
using this table we would win the match 13-7. If the match was part of
some larger competition, such as a league, then we would score 13
victory points and our opponents would score 7.

There are also events in which many teams of four compete. There are
various ways of organising these. At any particular time in such an
event you will be playing a part of a match against some other team, and
at some time your team-mates will play the other cards of the same
boards against the other half of that same team. The scores are
eventually compared to find how many IMPs you won or lost against that
team.

Another way of scoring teams of four is akin to the matchpoint scoring
used in pairs (see below <#pairs>). On each board you simply win, tie,
or lose depending on whether you score better, worse or the same as the
other team. This method is known as *board-a-match* or *BAM* in America;
in Britain it is usually called *point-a-board*.


      Pairs

This is the game most usually played in Bridge clubs, and there are also
many tournaments organised this way. As implied by the name, it is
played between a number of fixed partnerships or *pairs*. For a pairs
event you need a minimum of three tables (6 pairs, 12 players), and it
works better with more players - say 10 tables (40 players) or more.
With a very large number of players (say more than 70) it is usual to
split the tournament into two or more separate sections.

Generally you play two or three boards at a table - this is called a
*round* - and then one or both pairs move to another table and play
other boards against other opponents. The movement will be organised by
the director in such a way that no one ever plays boards they have
played before, or against opponents they have played before.

The score for each hand is recorded to a *travelling scoresheet* or
*traveller*, which is kept in the board, folded so that previous scores
cannot be read, either in a special pocket provided for this purpose, or
in the North pocket on top of North's cards. None of the players may
look at this sheet before the board has been played. North is then
responsible for entering the result and showing the completed sheet to
East-West to check that it has been done correctly. Each pair has a
number to identify them, and this must also be entered on the
scoresheet, to show whose result it is. North is also responsible for
the movement of the boards - checking at the start of the round that the
correct boards are being played and passing them on at the end of the
round.

At the end of the whole session, each scoresheet will contain the
results of all the pairs who have played that board. The scoresheets are
then collected by the organisers and the scores compared. The usual
method of scoring is in *matchpoints*. Each pair is awarded 2
matchpoints for each pair who scored worse than them on that board, and
1 matchpoint for each pair who scored equally. (In North America it is
customary to count just one matchpoint for each pair scoring worse than
you on a board, and half a matchpoint for those that are equal. This
obviously makes no difference to the final ranking order or percentages
scored by the pairs.) Half points are traditionally written as a
horizontal or diagonal stroke: ^_ or /.

A completed score sheet might look like this:

                   *Board No. 1*
Pair No.                         North-South   Match points 
NS   EW   Contract  By  Tricks   Plus  Minus    NS     EW
 1    8      4S      N    10      420            5      7
 2   13      3NT     S    10      430            8      4
 3   11      5C*     E     8      500           12      0
 4    9      4S      N    10      420            5      7
 5   14      4S      N    11      450           10      2
 6   12      5S      N    10             50      0     12
 7   10      3S      N    10      170            2     10

Then the total matchpoints scored by each pair over all the boards are
calculated. This is generally converted to a percentage for each pair of
the points they scored compared to the theoretical maximum. This gives a
fair comparison between pairs who have played different numbers of
boards. The winners are the pair with the highest percentage. There may
be prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, etc.

Another, less usual way of scoring pairs is with a version of the IMP
scoring used for team matches (see above <#imps>). There are two kinds
of IMP pair games: your score may be IMPed against every other pair that
played the same hands, or against a form of average of the scores of all
the pairs who played the hand.

Sometimes the movement is such that the North-South pairs stay put and
the East-West pairs remain East-West throughout. In this case the
results for the East-West pairs and the North-South pairs are separate,
and there are two winning pairs. To enable all the pairs to be placed in
a single ranking order, the last round is sometimes played with an
*arrow switch*. This means that the players who were previously
North-South play the East-West cards for that round and vice versa.

I am told that in many North American tournaments "pickup slips" are
used instead of travellers - that is, there is an individual score slip
for each table in each round. After North has filled out the details and
East or West has checked it, it's left face down on the table and picked
up by the organisers during the next round. When using a computer for
scoring, this allows the final scores to be calculated sooner, as
results of earlier rounds can be entered while the later rounds are
being played. It also prevents players from seeing the results obtained
by other players who previously played the same cards, which might be
considered an advantage or a disadvantage. Some European clubs have even
introduced a system whereby scores are entered directly into a computer
from a terminal at the table.


      Duplicate bridge procedure and ethics

During a duplicate event, where play will be in progress at several
tables at the same time, it is important that players do not see,
overhear or otherwise take an interest in the play at the other tables.
Any attempt to do so would be cheating, as it might give unauthorised
information <#ui> about the distribution of cards or the result of a
board which the player would later be playing. For similar reasons,
partners should not discuss the boards they have played in the hearing
of other players until the end of the event (or a suitable break at a
time when everyone has played the same boards).

In some places devices are used to enable the bidding to proceed
silently, reducing the chance of hearing bids from another table. The
best arrangement is for each player to have a *bidding box*, which is a
box containing cards displaying all the possible bids, pass, double and
redouble. At your turn you display the relevant card. All the cards used
for bids remain on view until the end of the auction, thus also avoiding
the problem of players forgetting or mishearing part of the bidding. A
cheaper but less satisfactory method is to use a large card with a
compartment for each possible bid; at your turn you point to the bid you
wish to make. I am told that in Australia, overhearing of bids is
commonly avoided by requiring bids to be written down rather than spoken.

In an event of any size, there will be a *tournament director* whose job
is to ensure that the play flows smoothly. This person will deal with
any infringements of the rules that occur, referring when necessary to
the laws <http://www.math.auc.dk/~nwp/bridge/laws/>. If some
irregularity occurs, such as a bid out or play out of turn, an illegal
bid or play, or discovering that the cards have been wrongly boarded
(the hands contain more or fewer than 13 cards), the director should be
called to the table. This should not be construed as an accusation of
cheating - the purpose of calling the director is simply to ensure that
the irregularity is sorted out fairly and in accordance with the rules.
The instructions and decisions of the director should be followed and
respected at all times. In a serious tournament, if you strongly
disagree with the director's ruling, it should be possible to appeal
against the director's decision. The procedure for this varies according
to the nature of the event - the director should be able to advise you
on the options.


      Stop and alert

In tournament bridge, if you make a bid at a level higher than necessary
in that denomination (a "jump" bid), you are supposed to precede your
bid by saying "stop" (or displaying your "stop" card if you are using
bidding boxes). The next player *must* then pause before bidding or
passing. The reason behind this is that after a jump bid the next player
may have reason to hesitate, as your unexpectedly high bid might have
disrupted the course of action which that player was planning. The
player is forced by the stop rule to hesitate anyway, so avoiding giving
unauthorised information <#ui>. Example:

    * North bids "one spade"
    * East bids "stop; three hearts"
    * South pauses and then passes 

If South had been planning to bid two spades, say, then he might need
time after East's unexpected jump to decide whether a three spade bid
would now be appropriate. As South is forced to pause, North gets no
clue as to whether the jump gave South a problem. Similarly, if South
instead bids three spades after the mandatory pause, he gives North no
clue as to whether he was considering a pass instead.

The idea of alerts is to warn the opponents of a bid (or double or pass)
which has an unexpected agreed meaning. It is always the duty of the
*partner* of the bidder to alert the bid when required. If using bidding
boxes, this is done by displaying the "alert" card. Otherwise the alert
is given by saying "alert" or (in Britain but not in North America) by
knocking the table. The definition of what bids require alerts varies
from place to place - it is determined by the bridge organisation under
whose aegis the tournament is being held. In Britain, most artificial
bids must be alerted; in North America, alerts are required for bids
which diverge from a defined standard set of meanings.

Since the late 1990's, "announcements" have been introduced in some
places. When bids with certain specific meanings are made, the bidder's
partner must say a specific phrase that explains the meaning of the bid.
For example the partner of a player who makes an opening bid of "one no
trump" might be required to disclose the partnership's agreed range of
strength for that bid in "high-card points" <#hcp>, by saying for
example "12 to 14" or "16 to 18".


      Unauthorised information

This is information which you obtain as a result of some irregularity in
the game, rather than as a legitimate deduction from the bidding and
play. Unauthorised information might arise from:

    * hesitation or undue haste in bidding or playing a card
    * seeing your partner's cards
    * extraneous remarks made during the game; questions about the
      bidding or play; also gestures, tone of voice, etc.
    * seeing or overhearing events at another table 

The principle is that you are allowed to take advantage of anything done
by your opponents at your table, but you are obliged to ignore any
unauthorised information gained from your partner's actions or other
tables.

In fact if you do obtain unauthorised information from your partner, you
should not only ignore it but be prepared to prove that you have done
so. This means that if you are involved in any kind of close decision
you ought to take the action *opposite* to the one indicated by the
information from your partner. For example if during the bidding your
partner passes after a hesitation, you must pass too unless you have a
cast iron case for bidding, otherwise you might be accused of making use
of the unauthorised information that your partner had nearly enough
strength to bid.

In bridge it is illegal to behave deliberately in such a way as to try
to give spurious information to the opponents. For example if you have
only one card of a suit that is led, it is illegal to hesitate before
playing it, creating the impression that you had more than one card to
choose from. (Even an inadvertent hesitation would be an offence, though
a less serious one, if it misled the opponents to your benefit, and the
director would adjust the score to give a fair result.) On the other
hand there is no ban on making deceptive bids and plays to confuse the
opponents - as long as these are not part of an undisclosed partnership
agreement. You are free for example to play a card different from what
might be expected from your holding, as long as you do it smoothly and
without comment. Similarly you are free to make a bid which is
inconsistent with your system to upset the opposition, provided that
this is as much of a surprise to your partner as it is to the opponents.


    Chicago

There are several versions of this game, also known in the official
rules as Four-Deal Bridge. As this name suggests it is a game for four
players which is complete in four deals, unlike Rubber Bridge <#rubber>,
where the length of a rubber is indefinite. This greater predictability
has made it popular in some American clubs where Rubber was formerly
played.

The vulnerability varies from hand to hand in a fixed pattern as follows:

    * Hand 1: Dealer North; neither side vulnerable
    * Hand 2: Dealer East; North-South vulnerable
    * Hand 3: Dealer South; East-West vulnerable
    * Hand 4: Dealer West; both sides vulnerable 

If all four players pass, the cards are shuffled again and the hand
redealt by the same dealer. The game bonus is 500 when vulnerable, 300
when not vulnerable. If a team makes a part score this is carried
forward to subsequent deals until one side makes a game. A team that
makes a part score in hand 4 that is not sufficient to complete a game,
they score a bonus of 100, but there is no bonus for any part scores
made in earlier hands.

*Example of scoring*

                         N-S     |   E-W
                                 |   
                        100 (d)  |   
                         50 (d)  |
                        200 (d)  |   500 (c)
                         60 (a)  |    30 (c)
                      ===========|===========
1. N deals, love all     60 (a)  | 
                                 | 
2. E deals, N-S vul              |    40 (b)
                                 |
3. S deals, E-W vul              |    60 (c)
                      -----------|-----------
4. W deals, game all     80 (d)  |
                        
                      ====================
Totals                  420          630      so E-W win by 210.

(a) On hand 1, N-S bid two spades and made 10 tricks, scoring 60 points
below the line plus 60 above for the overtricks. No game here because
N-S's score below the line is less than 100.
(b) On hand 2, E-W bid one no trump and made exactly seven tricks, for
40 points.
(c) On hand 3, E-W bid two hearts and won 9 tricks for 60 points below
and 30 above. This brings their score below the line to 100, which
counts as a vulnerable game because E-W are vulnerable for this hand,
even though this is the first game they have made.
(d) On hand 4, the final hand, N-S bid one no trump; although they are
doubled, they succeed in making eight tricks. This is worth 80 (2*40)
below the line, and above the line they score 200 for one vulnerable
overtrick plus 50 for making a doubled contract. However, this is not a
game: their 60 below the line from hand 1 no longer counts towards game
because of the game E-W made in hand 3. Therefore N-S score just a
further 100 for finishing with a part score.

*Note:* the original version of Chicago had the vulnerability reversed
in hands 2 and 3, so that the dealing side was vulnerable. The more
modern scheme, which has the non-dealing side vulnerable as shown above,
tends to lead to more competitive bidding.


      Chicago with Duplicate Scoring

Chicago is sometimes played using duplicate scoring <#dupscore>. There
is no accumulation of part scores or games from deal to deal - each deal
is scored separately, and a team making a part score gets an immediate
bonus of 50 as in duplicate. The sequence of vulnerability is fixed as
in the standard version.

A multiple of four hands can be played, repeating the sequence of
vulnerabilities as often as necessary. The result is simply the total
score over the deals played.


      Chicago with Russian Scoring

The following method of scoring Chicago originated in Russia. It
eliminates some of the luck of the deal by introducing an element of
IMPs scoring <#imps>.

On each deal, there is a target score which depends on the number of
high card points held. The cards are played in front of the players, as
in duplicate. At the end of the play, the high card points held by each
side are counted, according to the following scale:

    * each ace: 4 points
    * each king: 3 points
    * each queen: 2 points
    * each jack: 1 point 

There are 40 points in all. The team which held more high card points
finds its target score, which depends on whether they were vulnerable or
not, from the following table:

*High Card           Target	
 Points       Not Vul.  Vulnerable*

   40           1300       1950

The difference between the target score from the above table and the
actual score is then converted to IMPs, using the standard IMP table
<#imps>. The total IMP scores over a series of hands are totaled to give
an overall result.

For example, suppose we are East-West, and on the second deal of a
Chicago we bid three hearts and make 10 tricks. We then count our high
card points and discover that between us we had 24. We were vulnerable,
so our target score from the table was 290. We actually scored 170 (90
for the contract plus 30 for the overtrick plus 50 for the part score).
So we are 120 points short of our target. Therefore using the IMP table
<#imps>, our score for this hand is *minus 3 IMPs*.

Second example. In the first deal of a Chicago we bid and make 4 Spades
holding only 18 points between us. Our opponents had a target of 70 but
instead we made 420. The difference is 490 so we score *plus 10 IMPs*.


    The Beer Card

beer card

The Beer Card is the Seven of Diamonds. It is not part of the official
rules of Bridge, but there is a tradition among some players that if the
declarer succeeds in making the contract *and* wins the *last* trick
with the Seven of Diamonds, dummy must buy the declarer a beer of the
declarer's choice. In the same way, if the opponents defeat the contract
and one of them wins the last trick with the Seven of Diamonds, the
opponent who wins the last trick is bought a beer by the other opponent.

The Beer Card tradition originated in Copenhagen in the 1950's or
1960's. It was probably inspired by:

   1. the large reward for winning the last trick with a King or the
      Pagat (lowest trump) in the game of Danish Tarok
      <../tarot/dantarok.html>, or the bonus for winning the last trick
      with the trump 7 (the lowest trump) in the Danish form of Skat
      <../schafk/skat.html>;
   2. the fact that the diamond seven is a valuable card in the system
      of /bommelommer/ points - a way of evaluating a Bridge hand which
      has little or no connection with its usefulness in the game of
      Bridge, but was used in some Danish clubs as the basis of a
      side-bet between partners. Bommerlommer is a slightly
      old-fashioned Danish slang word for money. 


    Honeymoon Bridge

Bridge has become so popular and fashionable that some players can
hardly believe that any other card game is worth learning, but Bridge is
a four-player game. When two such people want to play cards and no other
players are available, instead of playing a card game designed for two
players, they sometimes prefer to resort to two-player adaptations of
Bridge, known as Honeymoon Bridge. There are several different versions,
all somewhat unsatisfactory. Rules can be found on the Honeymoon Bridge
page <honeymoon.html> of this site.


    Minibridge

Minibridge is a simplified version of Bridge that was introduced in
Europe in the 1990's as a teaching aid for new players. In its most
straightforward form it works as follows.

After the cards are dealt as usual, the players look at their cards and
count the number of high card points they hold according to the
following scale: ace=4, king=3, queen=2, jack=1, other cards zero. This
is the popular Milton Work point count used by many Bridge players to
evaluate the approximate strength of a hand for bidding purposes. But
instead of bidding in the usual way, in Minibridge each player in turn,
beginning with the dealer, simply announces his or her point count. The
point counts of the four players should add up to 40. The partnership
with the higher total point count plays the contract, the declarer being
the whichever player of that partnership holds more points. If each
partnership has 20 points there is a redeal by the same dealer. If both
members of the declaring partnership have the same number of points (for
example 12 each), the declarer is the member of the partnership who
spoke first - that is the dealer or the player to dealer's left.

The declarer's partner puts down the dummy, and the declarer, having
seen partner's hand announces whether the contract will be a "game" or a
"part score" and also the trump suit or "no trumps". Then the player to
declarer's left leads to the first trick and play proceeds as in normal
Bridge.

The scores for each trick above six are as usual: 20 if trumps were
clubs or diamonds, 30 if trumps were hearts or spades, and 40 for the
first trick and 30 for each subsequent trick if there are no trumps.

    * If the contract was "part score", it succeeds if the declarer's
      side wins at least seven tricks. The winning side scores the trick
      score plus a bonus of 50 points.
    * If the contract was "game", it succeeds if the declarer's side
      wins enough tricks to score at least 100 trick points - in other
      words at least 11 tricks if clubs or diamonds are trumps, at least
      10 tricks if hearts or spades are trumps, or at least 9 tricks if
      there are no trumps. In this case the declarer's side scores the
      trick score plus a bonus of 300 for the "game".
    * If the contract fails, the declarer's opponents score 50 points
      for each trick by which the declarer was short of the number
      needed to make the contract.

*Examples: *

    * Part score in no trumps. For 7 tricks declarer's side would score
      90. For 10 tricks they would score 180. if they took 5 tricks the
      other side would score 100.
    * Game in hearts. For 10 tricks declarer's side would score 420. For
      11 tricks they would score 450. If they took 7 tricks the other
      side would score 150.

There is no set overall target score. Players play an agreed number of
deals after which scores are compared to give the result.

There are several more elaborate versions of Minibridge played in
various parts of Europe. For example instead of players announcing their
points, each player writes on a slip of paper the number of points and
the number of cards held in each suit. Then players speak in turn,
starting with the dealer, the options being "pass" or "I open". If all
pass the cards are redealt. If a player opens, the opener's partner's
slip is passed to the opener, and the opener uses this to choose a
contract, which is like a bid in Contract Bridge - a number of tricks
above six and a trump suit or no trumps. After this, the opener's
left-hand opponent receives his or her partner's slip and can either
pass or "overcall". If the opponent passes the opener's contract is
played. If the opponent overcalls, he or she must name a contract higher
than the opener's bid: either more tricks or the same number of tricks
in a higher denomination. The opener can then bid again, and the
overcaller and opener continue to bid alternately, each bid being higher
than the last, until one of them passes. The final bidder becomes the
declarer and plays the final contract.

Further information about Minibridge can be found on the English Bridge
Union's Minibridge pages
<http://www.ebu.co.uk/education/minibridge/default.htm>.

In some places, declarers are provided with a "decision table" to help
them to decide what contract to announce. Here is a Minibridge Decision
Table <http://www.wbfteaching.org/extras/decision%20table.htm> from the
World Bridge Federation Teacher's Program.
